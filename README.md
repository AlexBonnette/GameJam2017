# GameJam2017-1

This is for all code and documentation regarding my group Game Jam 2017 project.

My three teammates and I presented this working game at the conclusion of the event. The presentations were posted to YouTube on 
the live stream (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skPqE6F1AYI). During the presentation, we experienced a minor technical issue 
(one of the controller's batteries died), but we were able to fix this reasonably quickly. If you wish to view our presentation, 
below is a quick summary of when we are actually presenting: 
Values in minutes:seconds into the YouTube video: 2:00 - 4:30, 7:10 - 9:40

One very important thing to note regarding this GameJam is that there was a theme. The theme was "deception". Hence, the reason 
for a minor inconsistency: the game's title.

While the YouTube gameplay video's title is "Alien Deicide", the main menu shows "Rainbow Kitten Adventures VR". This is due to a 
last-minute change that was desired, but unattainable before presentation time. Our original game title was as the main menu shows,
and two of the team members designed that title in Blender and saved it as a PNG. They changed their minds on the title the night 
before, but did not produce an accompanying PNG for it, so that when I was designing a main menu for the game towards the end of 
the event, I had no choice but to go with the original title (as I did not know how to operate Blender, nor did I have the time to 
learn how to at that exact point).
